fog is the Ruby cloud computing library, top to bottom:

* Collections provide a simplified interface, making clouds easier to work with and switch between.
* Requests allow power users to get the most out of the features of each individual cloud.
* Mocks make testing and integrating a breeze.

== Getting Started

  This version is intended for connecting to the BT redisde cloud (Pi-LAX1).

  for installation instructions see the wiki page at:

  https://collaborate.bt.com/wiki/display/NIMBUS/Chef+installation+instructions


Now type 'fog' to try stuff, confident that fog will let you know what to do. Here is an example of wading through server creation for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud:

  >> server = AWS.servers.create
  ArgumentError: image_id is required for this operation

  >> server = AWS.servers.create(:image_id => 'ami-5ee70037')
  <Fog::AWS::EC2::Server [...]>

  >> server.destroy # cleanup after yourself or regret it, trust me
  true

== Commands available on the BT cloud:

compute = Fog::Compute.new( :provider               => 'BT',
                            :bt_access_key_id       => ACCESS_KEY_ID,
                            :bt_secret_access_key   => SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)

compute.servers.all                                       # list all instances you own
compute.servers.all('i-01234aSDf', 'i-12345qWer')         # get details for specified instances
compute.servers.get('i-01234aSDf')                        # get details for the specified instance

server.create(:image_id  => 'pmi-2cfa6611',
              :groups    => 'default')                    # spin up a new server

server = compute.servers.get('i-01234aSDf')
server.console_output                                     # display the server console history
server.reboot                                             # reboot the server
server.destroy                                            # terminate the instance
server.ready?                                             # returns true if the instance is running

compute.addresses.all                                     # list all elastic ip addresses you own
compute.addresses.all('123.456.789.0', '123.456.789.1')   # get details for specified elastic ip addresses
compute.addresses.get('123.456.789.0')                    # get details for the specified elastic ip address

compute.security_groups.all                               # list all our security groups
compute.security_groups.all('i-01234aSDf', 'i-12345qWer') # get details for specified security groups
compute.security_groups.get('i-01234aSDf')                # get details for the specified security group

security_group = compute.security_groups.create(:name         => 'name_of_group',
                                                :description  => 'something descriptive')

security_group.authorize_port_range(80..80)                                               # authorise port 80 (defaults to tcp from anywhere)
security_group.authorize_port_range(8080..8081, :ip_protocol => 'udp',
                                                :cidr_ip     => '123.456.789.0/255)       # authorise port 80, udp from specified port range
security_group.revoke_port_range(8080..8081)                                              # revoke access
security_group.destroy                                                                    # delete security group

compute.flavors.all                                       # list all available flavors
compute.flavors.get('m1.small')                           # get details for the specified flavor

== Collections

A high level interface to each cloud is provided through collections, such as `images` and `servers`.
You can see a list of available collections by calling `collections` on the connection object. You can try it out using the `fog` command:

  >> AWS.collections
  [:addresses, :directories, ..., :volumes, :zones]

Some collections are available across multiple providers:

* compute providers have +flavors+, +images+ and +servers+
* dns providers have +zones+ and +records+
* storage providers have +directories+ and +files+

Collections share basic CRUD type operations, such as:
* +all+ - fetch every object of that type from the provider.
* +create+ - initialize a new record locally and a remote resource with the provider.
* +get+ - fetch a single object by it's identity from the provider.
* +new+ - initialize a new record locally, but do not create a remote resource with the provider.

As an example, we'll try initializing and persisting a Rackspace Cloud server:

  require 'fog'

  compute = Fog::Compute.new(
    :provider           => 'Rackspace',
    :rackspace_api_key  => key,
    :rackspace_username => username
  )

  # boot a gentoo server (flavor 1 = 256, image 3 = gentoo 2008.0)
  server = compute.servers.create(:flavor_id => 1, :image_id => 3, :name => 'my_server')
  server.wait_for { ready? } # give server time to boot

  # DO STUFF

  server.destroy # cleanup after yourself or regret it, trust me

== Models

Many of the collection methods return individual objects, which also provide common methods:
* +destroy+ - will destroy the persisted object from the provider
* +save+ - persist the object to the provider
* +wait_for+ - takes a block and waits for either the block to return true for the object or for a timeout (defaults to 10 minutes)

== Mocks

As you might imagine, testing code using Fog can be slow and expensive, constantly turning on and and shutting down instances.
Mocking allows skipping this overhead by providing an in memory representation resources as you make requests.
Enabling mocking easy to use, before you run other commands, simply run:

  Fog.mock!

Then proceed as usual, if you run into unimplemented mocks fog will raise an error and as always contributions are welcome!

== Requests

Requests allow you to dive deeper when the models just can't cut it.
You can see a list of available requests by calling #requests on the connection object.

For instance, ec2 provides methods related to reserved instances that don't have any models (yet). Here is how you can lookup your reserved instances:

  $ fog
  >> AWS[:ec2].describe_reserved_instances
  #<Excon::Response [...]>

It will return an {excon}[http://github.com/geemus/excon] response, which has `body`, `headers` and `status`. Both return nice hashes.

== Go forth and conquer

Play around and use the console to explore or check out the {getting started guide}[http://wiki.github.com/geemus/fog/getting-started-with-fog] for more details. Once you are reading to start scripting fog, here is a quick hint on how to make connections without the command line thing to help you.

  # create a compute connection
  compute = Fog::Compute.new(:provider => 'AWS', :aws_access_key_id => ACCESS_KEY_ID, :aws_secret_access_key => SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
  # compute operations go here

  # create a storage connection
  storage = Fog::Storage.new(:provider => 'AWS', :aws_access_key_id => ACCESS_KEY_ID, :aws_secret_access_key => SECRET_ACCESS_KEY)
  # storage operations go here

geemus says: "That should give you everything you need to get started, but let me know if there is anything I can do to help!"

All new work on fog is sponsored by {Engine Yard}[http://engineyard.com]

== T-Shirts

Wonder how you can get a shirt? Look no further!

* Blue shirts go to people who have contributed indirectly, where contribution is a judgement call on geemus's part (but he is a pretty nice guy).
* Grey shirts and a follow from @fog go to people who have made it on to the {contributors list}[https://github.com/geemus/fog/contributors] by submitting code.
* Black shirts go to people who have made it on to the {collaborators list}[https://github.com/api/v2/json/repos/show/geemus/fog/collaborators] by coercing geemus into adding them (geemus is currently the only member of this list).
